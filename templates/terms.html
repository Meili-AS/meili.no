            <h6>Last Updated: 2025-01-01</h6>

            <h4>1. Parties</h4>
            <p>These Terms of Sale govern the contractual relationship between:

                Seller: Meili AS, a company registered in Norway with organization number 931691163, located at
                Hunnsvegen 3, 2821 Gjøvik, Norway.

                Customer: Any individual or entity placing an order via https://meili.no.
                By placing an order, the Customer confirms they are at least 18 years old and agree to these Terms.</p>

            <h4>2. Payment</h4>
            <p>
                Accepted Methods: Credit/debit cards, bank transfers, or other payment options displayed at checkout.

                Currency: All transactions are processed in NOK (Norwegian Krone).

                Timing: Full payment is required before order processing. For failed payments, orders will be canceled.

                Security: Payments are processed securely via encrypted channels. Meili AS does not store payment
